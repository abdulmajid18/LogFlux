# LogFlux
# LogFlux - High-Performance Log Aggregation System

LogFlux is a **scalable, real-time log aggregation and monitoring system** designed for **high-performance infrastructure observability**. It efficiently collects, processes, and analyzes logs using **Kafka, Apache Flink, Elasticsearch, and Redis**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time log streaming** using Apache Kafka
- **Low-latency log processing** with Apache Flink
- **Fast log storage & querying** via Elasticsearch
- **Scalable event-driven notification system**
- **Lightweight log collection with Filebeat**
- **WebSocket-based live notifications**
- **Containerized using Docker & Kubernetes**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

| Component           | Technology               |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Language**      | Java (Core Java, High-Performance) |
| **Log Collection** | Filebeat                 |
| **Message Broker** | Apache Kafka             |
| **Stream Processing** | Apache Flink         |
| **Storage & Search** | Elasticsearch        |
| **Notifications**  | Redis Pub/Sub + WebSockets |
| **Deployment**     | Docker, Kubernetes       |

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

1. **Logs are collected** from applications using **Filebeat**.
2. **Logs are streamed** to **Kafka** for decoupling producers and consumers.
3. **Apache Flink processes logs** in real time (filtering, anomaly detection).
4. **Processed logs are stored** in **Elasticsearch** for fast querying.
5. **Notifications are pushed** via **Redis Pub/Sub & WebSockets** for real-time alerts.

üìå **Optional**: RabbitMQ can be added for additional message queuing if needed
